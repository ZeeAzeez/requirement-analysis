# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the first major phase of the SDLC where stakeholders’ needs are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It defines the project scope, ensures alignment with business goals, and reduces risks by catching issues early. The output—such as functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria—serves as the blueprint for design, development, and testing. In short, Requirement Analysis defines what the system should do before building the how.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Defines scope – prevents scope creep by clarifying what’s included.
Aligns with business goals – ensures the system solves real problems.
Reduces risks – catches issues early before costly rework.
Guides development – provides the blueprint for design and coding.
Improves communication – keeps stakeholders and developers aligned.
Sets validation standards – enables clear testing and acceptance.
